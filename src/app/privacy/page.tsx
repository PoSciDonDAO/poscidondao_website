          <p className="mb-4">
            We are very delighted that you have shown interest in our enterprise. Data protection is of a particularly
            high priority for the management of the PoSciDonDAO Foundation. The use of the Internet pages of the
            PoSciDonDAO Foundation is possible without any indication of personal data; however, if a data subject wants
            to use special enterprise services via our website, processing of personal data could become necessary. If
            the processing of personal data is necessary and there is no statutory basis for such processing, we
            generally obtain consent from the data subject.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The processing of personal data, such as the name, address, e-mail address, or telephone number of a data
            subject shall always be in line with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), and in accordance with
            the country-specific data protection regulations applicable to the PoSciDonDAO Foundation. By means of this
            data protection declaration, our enterprise would like to inform the general public of the nature, scope,
            and purpose of the personal data we collect, use and process. Furthermore, data subjects are informed, by
            means of this data protection declaration, of the rights to which they are entitled.
          </p>

          <p>
            As the controller, the PoSciDonDAO Foundation has implemented numerous technical and organizational measures
            to ensure the most complete protection of personal data processed through this website. However,
            Internet-based data transmissions may in principle have security gaps, so absolute protection may not be
            guaranteed. For this reason, every data subject is free to transfer personal data to us via alternative
            means, e.g. by telephone.

              The Internet pages of the PoSciDonDAO Foundation use cookies. Cookies are text files that are stored in a

            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Many Internet sites and servers use cookies. Many cookies contain a so-called cookie ID. A cookie ID is a
              unique identifier of the cookie. It consists of a character string through which Internet pages and
              servers can be assigned to the specific Internet browser in which the cookie was stored. This allows
              visited Internet sites and servers to differentiate the individual browser of the dats subject from other
              Internet browsers that contain other cookies. A specific Internet browser can be recognized and identified
              using the unique cookie ID.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4">
              Through the use of cookies, the PoSciDonDAO Foundation can provide the users of this website with more
              user-friendly services that would not be possible without the cookie setting.

              By means of a cookie, the information and offers on our website can be optimized with the user in mind.
              Cookies allow us, as previously mentioned, to recognize our website users. The purpose of this recognition
              is to make it easier for users to utilize our website. The website user that uses cookies, e.g. does not
              have to enter access data each time the website is accessed, because this is taken over by the website,
              and the cookie is thus stored on the user's computer system. Another example is the cookie of a shopping
              cart in an online shop. The online store remembers the articles that a customer has placed in the virtual
              shopping cart via a cookie.

              The data subject may, at any time, prevent the setting of cookies through our website by means of a
              corresponding setting of the Internet browser used, and may thus permanently deny the setting of cookies.
              Furthermore, already set cookies may be deleted at any time via an Internet browser or other software
              programs. This is possible in all popular Internet browsers. If the data subject deactivates the setting
