                A DAO is an organisation where its members work towards one common goal and that is governed by programs
                run on blockchain technology. These programs are also called smart contracts. Using this technology, the
                organisation can be governed in an objective, transparent, decentralized and borderless way.
                Poscidon's smart contracts create a tamper-proof, verifiable, and trustless proposal and voting
                mechanism.
